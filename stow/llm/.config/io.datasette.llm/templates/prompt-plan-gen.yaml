  # Generate a TDD Prompt Plan for Development

  I'll provide you with either:
  1. A specification for a new software project, OR
  2. An existing codebase description plus specifications for new features to add

  Your task is to:

  1. Analyze what I've provided and develop a step-by-step implementation plan
  2. For new projects: Break this plan into small, incremental features
     For feature additions: Break the new features into incremental changes that integrate with the existing codebase
  3. Create a comprehensive, markdown-formatted prompt document that I can use with a code generation LLM

  The prompt document should guide the code generation LLM to implement the work following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Each section should walk through a specific TDD cycle:

  1. RED: Write a small, focused test that fails
  2. GREEN: Write the minimal code needed to make the test pass
  3. REFACTOR: Improve the code, where necessary, while keeping the tests passing

  Your prompt document should:
  - Begin with an overview of the project context and the TDD approach
  - For existing projects: Include prompts to first understand the current architecture and test structure
  - Contain clear, separate sections for each feature and TDD cycle
  - Include specific instructions for generating tests before implementation
  - Ensure each step builds incrementally on previous steps
  - Format each prompt section in code blocks for easy copying
  - Provide enough context in each prompt for the code generation LLM to understand where we are in the development process

  For feature additions to existing code, include prompts that:
  - Analyze how the new feature will integrate with existing components
  - Identify which existing tests may need modification
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality
  - Consider refactoring opportunities that improve both new and existing code

  Format your prompt document using proper markdown with headings and explanatory text where needed. The document should be comprehensive enough that I can work through it sequentially with a code generation LLM to build the entire project or add new features in a test-driven manner.
